ICS major project for spring session 2025
# Basic Machine Learning Algorithms in C

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental Machine Learning (ML) algorithms using the C programming language. It was developed as part of the ICS Major Project by a team of five undergraduate students. While most ML libraries are typically built in Python, R, or MATLAB, our goal was to understand the inner workings of ML by building models from scratch in C â€” a low-level language that offers great control and performance.

## Motivation

With the rising popularity of machine learning, we wanted to explore how core ML concepts such as regression, classification, and clustering work under the hood. C provides a solid foundation for understanding memory management, data structures, and algorithmic logic, making it an excellent language to explore the fundamentals of ML.

## Features

We have implemented the following basic ML algorithms:

- **Linear Regression**  
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**

All algorithms are written from scratch without using external ML libraries.
